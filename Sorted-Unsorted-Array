This program creates 2 arrays with 10 capacity and random size.
One of the arrays is sorted from smaller to bigger number.
Numbers will be included arrays randomly.
End of the program it shows both of the array elements, capacity and sizes.
This is the first program that I created by using makefile and GNU tools.
